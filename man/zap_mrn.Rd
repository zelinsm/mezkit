\title{Clean and Validate MRN Column}
\usage{
zap_mrn(data, showdups = FALSE, inspectdups = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble that includes a column named \code{mrn}.}

\item{showdups}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints a summary table of duplicate MRNs to the console. This includes the MRN, any columns containing "date", and either the row number or the first column if it's not \code{mrn}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{inspectdups}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, opens a \code{View()} tab in RStudio showing all duplicate MRNs with all columns, plus any columns containing "date". Includes either the row number or the first column as an identifier. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The original data frame (with a cleaned \code{mrn} column), returned invisibly. Summary information is printed to the console.
}
\description{
\code{zap_mrn()} is a convenience function for standardizing and checking the integrity of a medical record number (MRN) column in a dataset. It trims whitespace, pads MRNs to 8 characters with leading zeros, and checks for missing or duplicate values.
}
\details{
If duplicate MRNs are found, the user can optionally print a summary of duplicate records to the console or open a detailed view of all duplicated rows in the RStudio \code{View()} pane.

library(dplyr)

# Sample dataset with duplicate and malformed MRNs
df <- tibble::tibble(
  mrn = c(12345, "6789012", "00001234", NA, "6789012"),
  visit_date = as.Date(c("2024-01-01", "2024-01-05", "2024-01-10", NA, "2024-01-05")),
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Bob Duplicate")
)

# Basic usage
cleaned <- zap_mrn(df)

# Show duplicates in console
zap_mrn(df, showdups = TRUE)

# Inspect duplicates in View tab
zap_mrn(df, inspectdups = TRUE)

}
